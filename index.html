        <h2>Freretown Secondary & YSK Partnership</h2>
        <p>Frere Town Secondary School has been dedicated to providing a holistic education for its students by focusing on both academic excellence and the development of practical skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). As part of these efforts, the school has established various initiatives, including the Y.S.K Coding Club, aimed at equipping students with essential digital skills for the 21st century.</p>

            <p><strong>Y.S.K PARTNERSHIP AND DONATION.</strong></p>
            On the evening of Saturday, 28th September 2024, our Y.S.K Coding Club received a generous donation of 10 computers  from Young Scientists Kenya (YSK). These computers are a significant boost to the ongoing coding program, which aims to teach students how to code and develop digital literacy skills. The Y.S.K Coding Club has been conducting coding classes as part of its curriculum and this donation will enhance the experience and opportunities for the students.

           <p><strong>IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS. </strong></p>
           This contribution has excited both the students and the staff at Frere Town Secondary School. The computers will provide a platform for practical, hands-on learning, and allow students to work on more complex projects and assignments. Our commitment is to ensure that each student maximizes this opportunity, learning to not only code but also think critically, solve problems  and innovate.

            <p><strong>Y.S.K’S EXPECTATIONS.</strong></p>
             <img src="img 31.jpg" width="450">
            YSK has expressed hope that this donation will increase the number of participants in the coding program and nurture a stronger coding culture within the school. We share the same vision and are working tirelessly to ensure that more students are encouraged to join the Y.S.K Coding Club. By leveraging this resource, we aim to have a larger number of students participate in coding activities, competitions  and projects that can impact their academic and future career paths.
            <p><strong>NEXT STEP.</strong></p>
            With the computers now in place, we plan to immediately expand the coding classes, providing each student with adequate time to engage with the new equipment. The excitement among students is palpable and we are optimistic that this momentum will drive an increase in participation and skill development. We are also exploring partnerships and opportunities to expose the students to coding competitions at both the national and international levels.
            

            <p><strong>CONCLUSION.</strong></p>
            We are extremely grateful to Y.S.K for their generosity and commitment to supporting our students' education. The donation of computers will undoubtedly transform our Y.S.K Coding Club and the learning experience at Frere Town Secondary School. Together, we are empowering the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers.
